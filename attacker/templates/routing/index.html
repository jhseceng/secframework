        About Cloudstrike
    </h4>
    <p class="card-text">
        With threat telemetry at scale, processing over 1 trillion events a week, CrowdStrike Falcon is an effective
        tool designed for threat detection and response across a variety of endpoints. CrowdStrike Falcon, built
        natively on the cloud, is designed to also natively provide protection for the cloud, leveraging both artificial
        intelligence (AI) and behavioral-based detections. With integrated threat analysis, CrowdStrike Falcon provides
        a combination of intelligence and security alerts to accelerate incident response, deliver enriched context,
        streamline the investigative process and drive more accurate security responses.</p>

    <p class="card-text">
        For years, organizations have struggled to effectively combine the capabilities of their SOCs with those of the
        cloud security teams and close the gaps in point products that are unable to visualize threats and compliance
        issues in cloud workloads. CrowdStrike provides a comprehensive solution designed to further enhance the
        security of workloads running on the already secure AWS, and address the compliance needs of DevSecOps teams
        using AWS Security Hub. Customers are able to leverage CrowdStrike Falcon as their security tool for workloads
        running on AWS and, combined with AWS Security Hub, allow for centralized and automated management of threat
        alerts from AWS services.</p>

    <p class="card-text">
        AWS Security Hub is designed to provide users with a comprehensive view of their high-priority security alerts
        and compliance status by aggregating, organizing, and prioritizing alerts or findings from multiple AWS
        services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macie as well as from APN security solutions.
        The findings are then visually summarised on integrated dashboards with actionable graphs and tables.

     <h4 class="card-title">About the Demo</h4>
    <p class="card-text">

        Security in the cloud is much like security in your on-premises data centersâ€”only without the costs of
        maintaining facilities and hardware. A large percentage of cloud based attacks still happen at the application
        layer. AWS provides a number of security tools to help protect cloud based applications. Attacks can happen in a
        number of way and security groups and WAF solution play an important role in securing web based applications
        they do not cover all application attack vectors.

    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
        With this demo we wish to show how security groups and Web Application Firewalls alone do not provide complete
        application coverage. Customers should implement a "defense in depth" approach for all applications. The demo
        focuses on a <a href="/vulnerability" target="_blank"> Java Deserialisaton Vulnerabilty </a> that existed in
        Jenkins servers in late 2015.
